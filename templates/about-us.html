				We, the team at ASDI, are a group of professionals who have years of consulting experience in different aspects of actuarial domain. Experiencing the gap between the theoretical knowledge and its application, we have an aim of promoting education by not only focusing on theoretical knowledge/material, but also by training students on the practical application of these theoretical concepts, which is a real test/requirement in any profession.
			</p>
			<p>
				A key gap that we have noticed in the demand – supply mismatch of jobs, is the level of practical approach of students. This basic underlying need of all recruiters is what we are trying to address through our approach. We train candidates on actuarial concepts, complementing it with a practical approach to ensure that candidates have a balanced approach towards the work that they are required to do in the industry. This mix of theory and practice makes a successful actuary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Keeping this theory in mind, we treat everybody as participants, rather than students, as we believe that this practical learning process is a collaborative effort and hence, everybody has to be an equal participant in the holistic learning process.

			<h2> Our Core Values </h2>
		<div class="core-value">
			
				<h3><i class="ion-ios-circle-filled"></i> Let our results do the talking</h3>
				<p>We do it in such a way that we deliver what we say we’re going to do, outstandingly.</p>
			

		
				<h3><i class="ion-ios-circle-filled"></i> Be passionate and determined</h3>
				<p>We are great because we all share the same underlying desire to be the best at what we do. We don’t take ‘no’ or ‘that’ll never work’ for an answer because if we had, then we would have never started in the first place.</p>
			
				<h3><i class="ion-ios-circle-filled"></i> Deliver WOW</h3>
				<p>‘Doing the job’ is not enough – WOW matters. At ASDI, anything worth doing is worth doing with WOW. There is nothing about us that is average – our service is not average, our programs are not average – our people can’t be average.</p>
			
				<h3><i class="ion-ios-circle-filled"></i> Take responsibility</h3>
				<p>Remember that the gap between what you SAY you want and what you ACTUALLY want to achieve is the discipline to act consistently until it’s done. To succeed in our role, we take 100% responsibility for both our results and non-results.</p>
			
				<h3><i class="ion-ios-circle-filled"></i> Embrace and drive innovations and improvements</h3>
				<p>We are always learning and always ready to find a better way to do things. Through innovation and iteration, we aim to take things that work well and improve upon them in unexpected ways.</p>
			
				<h3><i class="ion-ios-circle-filled"></i> Bring an insatiable hunger to learn and grow</h3>
				<p>We are interested in keeping up with new developments and knowledge in the field. We believe that if we want to continue leading the industry, we must continually embrace changes. At ASDI, we believe that inside every team member is more potential than even they themselves realize.</p>
